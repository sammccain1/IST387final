# The dataset reveals key patterns in transaction frequencies, with Report_Mobile=[0,1]. This item appears in 100% of transactions, which indicate a universal property of all transactions, such as all reports being mobile-based, or the variable being present across all data.A majority of transactions (81.3%) have a low rating (High_Rating=0), and 67.8% originate from the "Request Form" source. Significant portions of the data involve the agency "Garbage, Recycling & Graffiti" (44.3%) and transactions with a service-level agreement of 48 hours (34.9%). Geographic or numeric variables like Lat=[43.03,43.06) and Y=[5.317e+06,5.321e+06) are moderately represented (33.3%).
